# Data Structures and Algorithms
Data structures and algorithms should be seen as an important area that is fundamental to computer science. Data structures and algorithms are important aspects of computer science because they form the basic building blocks for developing logical solutions to problems and at the same time creating efficient programs that perform tasks optimally.
